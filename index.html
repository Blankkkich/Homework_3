      <h1>What is Git?</h1>
      <p>
        Git is a distributed version control system that tracks changes in any
        set of computer files, usually used for coordinating work among
        programmers collaboratively developing source code during software
        development. Its goals include speed, data integrity, and support for
        distributed, non-linear workflows (thousands of parallel branches
        running on different computers). Git was originally authored by Linus
        Torvalds in 2005 for development of the Linux kernel, with other kernel
        developers contributing to its initial development. Since 2005, Junio
        Hamano has been the core maintainer. As with most other distributed
        version control systems, and unlike most client-server systems, every
        Git directory on every computer is a full-fledged repository with
        complete history and full version-tracking abilities, independent of
        network access or a central server. Git is free and open-source software
        shared under the GPL-2.0-only license.
